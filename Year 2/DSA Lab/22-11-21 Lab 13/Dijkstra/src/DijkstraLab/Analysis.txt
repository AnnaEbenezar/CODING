Time: O(log3(N)) 
It's due to the if statement where we're dividing n by 3 at every applicable step.
Space: O(1) 
Due to not using any extra space.
Termination condition: n == 1

The code will keep dividing n by 3 or subtracting 1 from n until n == 1, w
here we can then count the number of steps taken.
